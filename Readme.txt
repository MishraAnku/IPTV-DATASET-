Introduction:
Recommender systems are among the most popular applications of data science today. They are used to predict “best next action” for a customer or “rating of preference” that a user would give to items. Today, major tech company has applied them in some form or the other. For example, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow, and Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, and so on. In general, there are three ways to build a recommendation engine:
1. Popularity based recommendation engine
2. Content based recommendation engine
3. Collaborative filtering based recommendation engine
Another type of recommendation system is Hybrid model which can be created by mixing two or more types of recommendation systems. This type of recommendation systems usually gives better performance.
